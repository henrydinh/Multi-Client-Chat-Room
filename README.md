#Chat Room for Multiple Clients Using Sockets.

Henry Dinh

The program contains a server and can connect multiple clients to it. The server host can set the maximum number of clients allowed to connect. Run the server first, and then run clients. The clients connect to the server via the server host machine's IP address.

## How to execute
Compile both the Server.java file and the Client.java file using the commands below.

Compile Server:
```
javac Server.java
```
Compile client:
```
javac Client.java
```

Then run the server and client using the commands below.

Run Server:
```
java Server
```
Run Client:
```
java Client
```
